# Assignment 2: Machine Learning


You have 10 days to work on a machine learning algorithm.
I want you to pick one of the following use cases and make a prediction algorithm using either regression or classification algorithms.

Do the following:
1. Pick one use case (defined below).
2. Explore and research which algorithm would work best for this use case (regression or classification)
3. Document your findings in a ReadMe.md file (3-5 lines) on why you chose this algorithm. 
4. Code the algorithm using Python
5. Keep the solution as simple as possible. We are not looking for the best machine learning algorithm. We are interested in seeing that you know how to work with machine learning.
6. Publish the code on GitHub and send us the link

The use case i chose was stock market price prediction.
I used the regression algorithm because I am working here with numerical values and not cathegorical values that are commonly
used in classification alghorithm. While predicting over time it is easier to deal with regression and not classification.
